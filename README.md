# ITE1100_Tutorial4
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how Git and GitHub works. This tutorial will guide you to initialize and manage a local Git repository, create, commit, push, and merge changes in Git using branches and pull requests, as well as collaborating with other using GitHub.

How to setup a Git repository:

- Install Git on your local machine and create a GitHub account.

- Create a local Git repository on your computer (git init).

- Create a new (test) branch in your repository (git branch -b test).

- Add a new file to your repository (git add).

- Commit the new file with a clear message (git commit -m)

- Push the new branch to GitHub.

- Choose one classmate and add them as a Collaborator on your GitHub repository. 

- Create a Pull Request (PR) and assign your collaborator as the Reviewer. 

- Wait for your collaborator to review and approve your PR. 

- Once approved, merge the new branch into the main branch.
